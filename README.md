# Image-based-Plant-Phenotyping-using-Reduced-Parameter-CNN.
Segmentation is the core of most plant phenotyping applications. Current state-of-the-art plant phenotyping applications rely on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Phenotyping applications relying on these deep CNNs are often difficult if not impossible to deploy on limited-resource devices.
This work is a first step to moving plant phenotyping applications in-field and on low-cost devices with limited resources. 
This work re-architect four baseline deep neural networks (creating what we term "Lite CNN") by reducing their parameters whilst making them deeper to avoid overfitting.

# Minimum dependencies required to use these codes:
Python 3.6.1

Keras 2.0.6

Tensorflow 1.3.0

Numpy 1.13.3

Pillow 5.1.0

Opencv 3.2.0

# Running the codes:
Use train.py to train the baseline models and train_lite.py can be used to train the "Lite" models

Use evaluate.py to evaluate the baseline models and evaluate_lite.py to evaluate the "Lite" models.

Most network parameters can be changed in the parameter file.

All CNN models are contained in the Models folder
